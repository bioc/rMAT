Description: This package is an R version of the package MAT and contains functions to parse and merge Affymetrix BPMAP and CEL tiling array files (using C++ based Fusion SDK and Bioconductor package affxparser), normalize tiling arrays using sequence specific models, detect enriched regions from ChIP-chip experiments. Note: users should have GSL anf GenomeGraphs installed. Windows users: 'consult the README file available in the inst directory of the source distribution for necessary configuration instructions'. Snow Leopard users can take advantage of increase speed with Grand Central Dispatch!
